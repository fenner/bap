detect recursive rules

optimize 0*1x to [x].  already do this for 0*1(x).

word-wrap output.

intelligently word-wrap output. (is there such a thing?)

fix output for
hello = goodbye ( foo
goodbye = blah

add comments to plaintext strings or ranges
e.g., %x30-39 ; "0" - "9"

add warning about using %x22 or DQUOTE instead of <">

handle syntax error of missing rule, just leading "="
 (initial attempts caused shift/reduce or reduce/reduce conflicts!)
